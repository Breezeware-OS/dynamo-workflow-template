## üöÄ Getting started

### Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the **Dynamo Workflow** BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) model used in the Dynamo Healthcare application. The workflow is designed to streamline patient visits by orchestrating interactions between patients, care teams, and physicians. Leveraging **Camunda BPMN**, this workflow ensures efficient task management, seamless collaboration, and enhanced patient care.
This guide walks through setting up your **Dynamo Workflow** app using Docker Compose. It also covers how to set up authentication using Keycloak.

| Release Name | Description | Release Date       |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| MVP - 1.0.0  |The **Dynamo Workflow** BPMN model is a robust framework designed to enhance patient care by automating and managing healthcare workflows. By clearly delineating roles, tasks, and decision points, it ensures that all stakeholders collaborate effectively, leading to improved patient outcomes and streamlined healthcare processes. Leveraging Camunda BPMN provides the flexibility and scalability needed to adapt to evolving healthcare needs. | 04-10-2024 |

## Using Docker Compose

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following are installed and available on your system:

* **Docker** or **Docker Desktop -**  (Docker Version - 20.10.x and above)
* Open ports: **8080**, **8081**, **3000**, **3001**, **3002**, **5432 -** Ensure that the following ports are not in use:

### 1.1 Setup with Docker Compose

1. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
2. Run the following command to start the Docker containers:

   ``` bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   This command will pull and download the necessary containers, and the client will run on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
4. Default Credentials for **patient app**(http://localhost:3000) - No Credentials  
   **careteam app**(http://localhost:3001) - **Username**: careteam@breezeware.net **Password**: breeze123 or Signup.  
   **provider app**(http://localhost:3002) - **Username**: provider@breezeware.net **Password**: breeze123 or Signup (open in new browser window or incognito).

5. Application Port
    * **Backend Server** - 8081
    * **Patient Frontend Client -** 3000
    * **Careteam Frontend Client -** 3001
    * **Provider Frontend Client -** 3002
    * **Auth Server -** 8080

### 1.2 If Docker not installed - Docker Installation

#### **For Docker on Linux:**

1. Update your packages:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```
2. Install Docker using:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker.io
   ```
3. Verify installation:

   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

#### **For Docker Desktop on Mac/Windows:**

1. Download and install Docker Desktop from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Follow the installation instructions and start Docker Desktop.

### 1.3 Troubleshooting

#### Checking and Managing Active Ports

Ensure that the following ports are not in use:

* **8080**
* **8081**
* **3000**
* **3001**
* **3002**
* **5432**

If any of these ports are active, you need to free them by killing the respective processes. You can check for active ports using:

```bash
lsof -i :<port_number>
```

To kill a process on a specific port:

```bash
kill -9 <process_id>
```

#### If you encounter file permission issues, use the following command:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER postgres-data/
```

#### If this doesn‚Äôt resolve the issue, try:

* Resetting changes with Git:

  ```bash
  git checkout .
  ```
* Deleting the project and re-cloning it.

#### If you encounter Error response from daemon: pull access denied for public.ecr.aws, use the following command:

```bash
docker logout public.ecr.aws
```



---

## Additional Notes

* Always verify that no other processes are using ports **8080**, **8081**, **3000**, **3001**, **3002**, or **5432** before running the services.
* If you encounter port issues, repeat the process to kill active ports as mentioned above.
